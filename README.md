# clustering_bovespa_stocks

Clustering of the Bovespa stocks using Ward-linkage and score indicators, where the attributes are the fundamental indicators such as P/E, CAPEX/FCO, ROA, ROE, Dividend Payout. It is important to note that we did not involve the stock price in the analysis, since the objective was to group the companies by fundamentals and avoid market speculations.

**Insights:**

We have successfully divided the companies in 10 clusters, each one having a unique set of important caracteristics related to debt, profit, investment (CAPEX), payout, assets, margins. Notably, the two biggest clusters are composed by high yield, low or no debt, and positive profit companies, and the two smallest clusters by companie with high or out of control debts, and negative profits.
